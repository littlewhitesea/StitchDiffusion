## StitchDiffusion Code
```python
TBD
```

## Useful Tools

[360 panoramic images viewer](https://renderstuff.com/tools/360-panorama-web-viewer/): It could be used to view the synthesized 360-degree panorama.

[Seamless Texture Checker](https://www.pycheung.com/checker/): It could be employed to check the continuity between the leftmost and rightmost sides of the generated image. 

## Statement
This research was done by Hai Wang in University College London. The code and released models are owned by Hai Wang.
